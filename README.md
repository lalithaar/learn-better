# 🧠 Learn Like You Are 5

> _Start with the textbook definition. End with a 5-year-old nodding back at you._

**Learn Like You Are 5** is a gentle, structured tool that helps you understand complex topics deeply — not by memorizing, but by breaking them down, connecting the dots, and explaining them like you would to a curious child.

From confusion to clarity — through analogies, reflection, and self-kindness. By the end, you’ll have clean notes and a clearer mind.
